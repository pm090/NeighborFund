## Purpose
NeighborFund creates a shared Capital One account for each community that collects money through crowfunding. Users can form or join communities, and invite other members to join. All members of the community share equal access to the money collected in their community. To join a community, approval from at least two-thirds of the community is required. Fundraising posts must also be approved by two-thirds of the community it is posted in. NeighborFund ensures security by requiring users to upload documentation of the usage of the money, such as financial statements and budget reports. Also, alerts are sent to members of the community when ever money is withdrawn from the account. In the future, two-factor authentication can be added to make NeighborFund safer.
